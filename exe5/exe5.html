					<p class="well">This is Sam. Sam was born to Hamfast Gamgee and Bell Goodchild on April 6th, 2980 TA, in a small region of Eriador, MiddleEarth, called the Shire, which was mostly inhabited by hobits. Sam never did much of his life other than be a gardener for the Baggins', a wealthier family of the Shire. He was always considered a simple hobbit, of plain speech. He did however have a great love for Elves and their culture, believing the world contains greater wonders than most hobbits are aware of (this always nurtured by his tutor Bilbo Baggins). </p>

					<p class="well">At a certain point in his life, Sam was recruited by Gandalf to help Frodo take the One Ring to the fiery realm of Mordor, to destroy it in Mount Doom. That is when his whole life changed. And that's it. Sam put himself out of his comfort zone, and he became one of the greatest heroes in all of history. Without him, Frodo might have never been able to fully complete his taks. Sam's support was paramount. Be like Sam.</p>
